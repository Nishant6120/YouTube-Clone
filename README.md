# My First HTML & CSS Webpage (YouTube Layout Clone)

This repository contains the code for my very first webpage built using HTML and CSS. The project is a basic attempt to replicate the layout of the YouTube homepage. It demonstrates my initial understanding of structuring web content with HTML and applying styles using CSS.

**Please note:** This is a simplified clone and does not include the full functionality or dynamic elements of the actual YouTube website. It focuses primarily on replicating the visual structure and basic styling.

## Features

* **Basic YouTube Homepage Layout:** The webpage attempts to recreate the fundamental layout of the YouTube homepage, including:
    * A header area (though non-functional).
    * A sidebar navigation (visually represented).
    * A grid-like display area for video thumbnails.
    * Visual representation of video thumbnails, titles, channel names, and view/age information.
* **Demonstrates Foundational HTML:** The HTML structure uses semantic elements (where appropriate for a basic clone) to organize the content.
* **Basic CSS Styling:** The CSS aims to mimic the visual appearance of the YouTube layout, including:
    * Color schemes.
    * Basic typography.
    * Layout using techniques like floats or basic flexbox/grid (depending on the complexity I was able to achieve at the time).
    * Sizing and spacing of elements.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Used to structure the content of the webpage.
* **CSS:** Used to style the visual presentation of the HTML elements.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
    *(Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the cloned directory in your file explorer and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    You will see a static representation of a basic YouTube homepage layout.

## Learning Points

This project was a learning exercise to grasp the fundamentals of:

* Creating a basic HTML document structure.
* Understanding different HTML elements and their usage.
* Applying CSS rules to style HTML elements.
* Experimenting with layout techniques.
* Connecting an HTML file to an external CSS stylesheet.

## Further Improvements (Potential Future Steps)

While this is a basic clone, future improvements could include:

* More accurate replication of the YouTube layout.
* Using more advanced CSS layout techniques (Flexbox or Grid).
* Adding responsiveness to the layout.
* Attempting to add basic interactive elements (though the focus of this project was primarily layout and styling).

## Contributing

As this is my first personal project for learning purposes, contributions are not actively sought at this time.
